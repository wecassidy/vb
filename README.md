  - With two authors: `(<name> and <name>, <year>)`
  - With three or more authros: `(<name> et al, <year>)`
- Principal researcher's name goes first

## Graphs

- Title
- Axis labels
  - 10pt Times
  - Labels should align with axis direction
  - `<symbol> (<unit>) →`
- Numbers should be horizontal
- Axes scaled in multiples of 1, 2, or 5

  - 9pt Times
  - Same width as graph, justified
  - First line indented 0.762 cm (0.3 in)

## Tables

- Left column should be the index (required with more than 5 rows)
- Header format (uncertainty optional):
  ```
  <name> (<symbol>)
  (<uncertainty> <unit>)
  ```
- Header text centred
- At least 10pt Times
- Borders
  - 40% grey (`#666, rgb(102, 102, 102)`)
  - 2.25 pt outer, 0.75 pt otherwise
- Uncertainties go in the same cell as the data point
  - If all the uncertainties in a column are equal, it should be placed with the units in the header
- Table cell contents aligned at ± symbol
- Use units as measured for raw data, [MKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKS_system_of_units) system otherwise
  - Explain decision
- Uncertainties must not be percentages; use exact values
